<h1> Sam's Versioning: Samver </h1>

<h2> Stop Abusing Semver </h2>

<p>
I like semver. I work as a systems folk, and I end up neck deep in other peoples' dependencies more often than I would
like. For libraries, semver is pretty good.
</p>

<p>
That said, I've run into a cult of programmers who see semver as the best thing next to Jesus coming back for solving
all their problems. And they go to alllll the meetings. Some things I've seen:

<ul>
  <li> Making an API for an external bank? Put semver in the URL so they can pick their version! </li>
  <li> Oh you're on version 1.124.0 huh? That many commits and not a single breaking change. Right. </li>
  <li> 0.2.191. In a Jenkins job. </li>
  <li> A Helm chart wraps a Docker container which wraps a binary, and two sidecars. They <i>all</i> have different
    semvers. Question for the audience: What broke?</li>
  <li> Try out Go modules! How many 0.0.0-x-y modules can you find? </li>
  <li> Chef Cookbooks. There is no one better than old school SysAdmins for defining programatic interfaces. What better
    way to discover a patch bump was a lie than 2000 servers telling you in slack?</li>
</ul>

<p>
The key idea around semver is around choice. If your users have the ability to actively choose what version of your
software they're using, it works. But large amounts of software is foundational, in that it needs to keep working for a
long time to allow for progress to be made above it. This is common in infrastructure, where we are so low in the stack
the ripple effects of changes end up costing an enormous amount.
</p>

</p>
If your users don't have a choice of consuming your software (its behind an API, its a hidden script that produces a
report, etc), <b>dont break your API.</b> Make a new thing, name it something else, figure out the migration that makes
sense for you and your users. And if you learn to communicate major releases within the context of your users, theres
probably a good chance you could use that knowledge to better communicate features and bugfixes than trying to encode
it into a single number thats incidental to your package manager.
</p>

<p>
Do your users even care what version of your software they're using? Or do they just want it to work?
</p>


<p>
Another small note, when dealing with automated CI/CD pipelines, the developer must always specify the semver to the
automation. Semver throws a complexity wrench in what would otherwise be straight-forward automated releases. Determining
what changed at an interface level in the best case requires scraping contrived commits or doc files in the repository,
which must be reliably updated by every developer (lol).
</p>

<h2> An Alternative </h2>

<p>
Are you releasing software to other developers who are making concious choices on when and how to depend on your software,
as part of a dependency tool (like ruby gems) across an organizational boundary? Then maybe use semver.
</p>

<h4> OTHERWISE </h4>

<p>
Without outside information, when trying to communicate a feature or a bugfix, whats easier, "/foo was added in version
27" or "/foo was added in 2008.02.28" ?
</p><!–– 23 skidoo ––>

<ul>
  <li>
  Right, so <b> lets use a date. </b>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Who's date? The date the customer sees it or the date the developer wrote it? Hopefully you have a continuous deployment
pipeline in place, in which the customer gets an evergreen version without thinking about it, in which case our versioning
should be developer centric.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  So <b> lets use the commit date of the code.</b> (All artifacts are generated from source control right?)
  </li>
  <li>
  But which branch? Oh no. So <b> lets add the commit SHA.</b> But not too long there.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b> Oh and I want it sortable. </b>
  </li>
</ul>

So lets use:
<h1> YEARMONTHDAYHOURMINUTE-GITSHA(short), ex: 201909031732-aa314da </h1>

<p>
<pre>

#!/usr/bin/env bash
# -- samver
# -- in a git repo, spits out a goodly version

if date --version 2>/dev/null; then
  # GNU
  echo $(date --utc --date="$(git show -s --format=%ci)" +%Y%m%d%H%M)-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
else
  # BSD
  echo $(date -u -j -f %s $(git show -s --format=%ct) +%Y%m%d%H%M)-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
fi
</pre>
